# Student counter webapp

## Live-demo -> https://student-count.netlify.app/

## What I've done;
This is my first Javascript project. In this project, I have learnt fundamentals of Javascript such as script tag, variables, numbers and strings, console.log, how to create functions, how to call/invoke functions from html file, the dom concept, getElementById, innerText and textContent.

For this project, I have made some customization, instead of increment, save and previous entries sections. I have added decrement button to decrease the number, total number of students section and a reset button with a popup message.
